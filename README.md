**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Project Description

Drag and Drop elements around columns

Demo project contains data like Kanban developer tasks, with three columns to move it

This repository contains a demo project built using SwiftUI, connected. 
The project adheres closely to the principles of Clean Architecture, with a focus on SOLID principles. Notably, no third-party libraries have been used in the development of this project.

## Next Steps

- **SwiftData persistance**
- **Developers CRUD**
- **Tasks CRUD**

## Features

- **SwiftUI Implementation**: The user interface is built entirely using SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

- **Clean Architecture**: The project follows the Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into layers such as Presentation, Domain, and Data layers. This ensures modularity, maintainability, and testability of the codebase.

- **SOLID Principles**: The codebase adheres to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), promoting code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains SwiftUI views, view models, and UI-related logic.
  
- **Domain Layer**: Defines business logic and entities that are independent of any specific UI framework or data source.

- **Data Layer**: Handles data retrieval and storage, including networking with the Rick and Morty API.
